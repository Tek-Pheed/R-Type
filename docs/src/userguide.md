### Multiplayer Across Two Computers

To play with another person on a different computer :

- One computer runs the server.

- The second computer runs the client.

- Alternatively, one computer can run both the server and a client, while another computer runs an additional client.

- There can be multiple clients running on one computer, but only one server per computer.

## How to Play

### Server Functionality

Once launched, the server runs in the background and displays logs. No user interaction is required.

### Client Side

When launching the client, three buttons appear :

- PLAY

- SETTINGS

- EXIT

### Play Menu

The PLAY button leads to another menu with four input fields and two buttons :

- Nickname input : Click and enter your desired username.

- IP Address input : Click and enter the server's IP.

- If playing locally or hosting, enter **127.0.0.1**.

- If the server is running on another computer, enter its IP address (e.g., 192.168.123.132).

- TCP Port and UDP Port inputs (default 8081 and 8082). Usually, these do not need modification.

- **Play Game button** : Starts the game.

- BACK button : Returns to the main menu.

### Settings Menu

The settings menu contains six buttons :

- Four buttons to configure movement controls.

- One button to toggle Auto Fire.

- BACK button to return to the main menu.

#### To change movement controls :

- Click the button (e.g., MOVE_UP).

- Then press the desired key on your keyboard. The new key is saved automatically.

- For Auto Fire, it's disabled by default :

- Click Auto Fire to toggle between "YES" and "NO".

- Movement keys control ship movement, and auto fire allows automatic shooting. If auto fire is off, pressing the **Spacebar** is required to shoot.

### The EXIT button closes the game

### Lobby

- After clicking **Play Game**, the lobby screen appears.

- Displays all connected players.

- The first player to join is the Host.

- If the Host disconnects, the second player becomes the new Host automatically.

- The Host can configure game settings.

### Lobby Options

The host can modify six game settings :

- Gamemode : WAVE (enemy waves) or PVP (1v1 player battle).

- Number of Players : Choose between 4 and 10.

- Difficulty : Easy, Medium, or Hard (affects enemy damage and health).

- Level: Select a level from the /assets/levels directory. Each level is defined by a .txt configuration file, specifying enemy types, spawn locations, background, music, and other game parameters.

- Bonus : Yes or No (enables/disables in-game bonuses).

- Launch Game : Starts the match.

### In-Game Controls

- Use movement keys to navigate.

- Shoot enemies to survive (press **Spacebar** if Auto Fire is off).

- Avoid getting hit (you have 100 HP).

### In-Game Exit

Press Esc to exit the current game and go back to the main menu.

### Game Objective

In Wave Mode, survive as long as possible and defeat enemy waves.

In PVP Mode, challenge another player in a 1v1 battle and be the last one standing.
