# {E} R-Type

## Overview
R-TYPE is a project designed to introduce developers to networked video game development, focusing on advanced C++ techniques and software engineering practices. The objective is to create a multi-threaded server and a graphical client for a reimagined version of the classic horizontal shoot-'em-up game, **R-Type**, using a custom-designed game engine.

The development process is divided into two phases:

Core Architecture: Build the foundational elements of the game and deliver a functional prototype.

Enhancements: Expand and refine the prototype, exploring specialized features and techniques from a provided list of options.

R-Type, originally released in the late 1980s, became a massive success in the gaming community, inspiring numerous ports, spin-offs, and remakes. While not the first of its kind, it set a high standard for horizontal shoot-'em-up games. Other notable games in this genre include the Gradius series and Blazing Star for Neo Geo.

## 1. Requirements
This project requires the following:
- **Development Environment**: A modern C++ compiler with C++17 support.
- **Operating System**: Linux or Windows
- **Additional Tools**: CMake for project building and management.
- **Network Requirements**: The game must support multiplayer functionality, allowing several players to team up against the evil Bydos.
- **Game Engine Design**: The internal architecture must reflect the structural complexity and modularity of a real game engine.

## 2. Libraries Used
The project is developed using the following libraries:
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**: Used for graphics, audio, and event handling.
  - [Official SFML Website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- **Criterion**: For unit testing during development.
