1.  Introduction

   The communication between the server and the client will be done
   using TCP as well as UDP.  The protocol used will be specified for
   each instructions and must be used accordingly by both sides.

   The format that should be use is

   CODE "SPACE" [ARGS] "HLTF"

   The code is composed of three numbers, each ten representing a
   category of instructions (100 for Player, 110 for enemies, etc...),
   excepting the connection management who will be set at 900.

   followed by a space, then the optional arguments, represented between
   parenthesis on the next pages.

   All of the instructions will be ended by a "\t\n", which will be used
   by both the client and server to separate paquets.

   An exemple of a valid instructions would be

   "901 4\t\n"

   The protocol used (TPC/UDP) will be explicitly precised, and the way
   the paquet is sent will also be showned

   *  -> From Server to Client

   *  <- From Client to Server

   *  <-> From Both

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Connection handshake

   This process is done when a new player connect.  The process is made
   so the server can identify which client is associated to which UDP
   socket.

   TCP Server--901-ClientId-->Client

   UDP Server<--902-ClientId--Client

   TCP Server---903-OK/KO---->Client

4.  Connection Management (900)

   The instructions used regarding the connection of the client and
   server are

   *  Init UDP Connection (clientID) - 901 -> TCP

   This is the first isntruction sent to the server, its used so the
   client knows its id.

   *  Start UDP (clientId) - 902 <- UDP

   As seen in the handshake, this instructions is used to associate a
   UDP socket to a client.

   *  Authenticated client (OK/KO) - 903 -> TCP

5.  Player Management (100)

   The following isntructions are the one used to manage players

   *  Player connection (clientId, name, x, y) - 101 <-> UDP

   This is sent to all the clients when a new player join the game.

   *  Player change position(clientId, x, y) - 102 <-> UDP

Internet-Draft               R-Type Protocol               December 2024


   This instructions is sent by both the server and the client to update
   the position of a specific player.

   *  Player killed (id) - 103 -> UDP

   Used when a player die, so it can be removed from the clients and
   server.

   *  Player shooting (id) - 104 <-> UDP

   Allow the server to process the shoot and its collision, and the
   client to create a projectiles on their screen.

   *  Player damage (id, newHealth) - 105 -> UDP

   Set the player health.

   *  Player disconnection (id) - 106 <-> UDP

   Used when a player disconnect, has the same behaviour as the
   instruction 103.

6.  Enemy Management (110)

   This are the instructions used to manage the enemies

   *  Enemy spawn (id, x, y) - 111 -> UDP

   Sent by the server to all the clients to spawn an enemy at a specific
   position.

   *  Enemy change position (id, x, y) - 112 -> UDP

   *  Enemy killed (id) - 113 -> UDP

   Remove an enemy if it has been shot down or if it reach the border of
   the screen.

   *  Enemy shooting (id) - 114 -> UDP

   Create a projectile from an enemy position.  It allows the client to
   create a projectile at the position.

   *  Enemy damage (id, new_health) - 115 -> UDP

   Set the health of an enemy.

7.  Terrain management (120)

   To manage the terrain, this are the instructions used

   *  Terrain spawn (x, y) - 121 -> UDP

   Spawn terrain at a specific postion on all the clients.

   *  Terrain destroyed (x, y) - 122 -> UDP

   Removed a terrain, if its has been destroyed or went off the screen.

8.  Game Mechanics (130)

   *  New wave (waveNb) - 131 -> UDP

   *  Wave over (waveNb) - 132 -> UDP

   *  Win - 133 -> UDP

   *  Lose - 134 -> UDP

   *  Game Over - 135 -> UDP
