# Entity Component System (ECS)

An Entity-Component System (ECS) is a software design pattern used in game
development and other simulations.

It organizes data and behavior into entities (objects), components (data), and
systems (logic).

This approach improves flexibility and performance by separating data from
functionality.

All classes of this libs are in the namespace ``ecs``.
